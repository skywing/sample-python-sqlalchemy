### VS Code Intelisens for SQLAlchemy
These are PEP-484 typing stubs for SQLAlchemy 1.4 and 2.0. They are released concurrently along with a Mypy extension which is designed to work with these stubs, which assists primarily in the area of ORM mappings.
The stubs replace the use of the “sqlalchemy-stubs” package published by Dropbox. Differences include that these stubs are generated against 1.4’s API as well as some adjustments to the use of generics
